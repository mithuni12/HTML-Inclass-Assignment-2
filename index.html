            <p id="style2">Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that merges engineering, computer science, and
                technology to create machines capable of performing various tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously.
                These robots are often programmed to perform specific tasks, such as assembling products on a factory
                line, assisting in surgeries, or even exploring distant planets. Robotics has opened new possibilities
                for industries, healthcare, exploration, and personal use, leading to innovation in sectors that
                previously relied heavily on manual labor.</p>
            <p id="style2">In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and sensor
                technologies have greatly enhanced the capabilities of robots. They are no longer just machines
                following preset instructions, but autonomous systems capable of learning, adapting, and interacting
                with their environment. From robotic arms in manufacturing to drones in agriculture, the world of
                robotics is rapidly evolving and has become a critical part of modern society.</p>

            <h2 id="style1"><B>Robots in Industry: Key Advancements in Industrial Automation</B></h2>
            <p id="style2">Robots are revolutionizing industrial sectors by automating processes that previously
                required human labor. The most common types of industrial robots include robotic arms, which are widely
                used in the automotive, electronics, and consumer goods industries. These machines can perform tasks
                with precision, speed, and endurance beyond human capabilities, such as welding, painting, assembling,
                and packaging.</p>
            <p id="style2">In addition to reducing production time and costs, industrial robots can work in hazardous
                environments where human safety might be at risk, such as in handling toxic materials or working in
                extreme temperatures. As the demand for mass production grows, robots are becoming essential for
                maintaining the pace and quality required in modern manufacturing. The future of industrial robots
                includes increased collaboration between robots and humans, with robots assisting workers in complex
                tasks that require high-level decision-making.

            <P id="style2">Humanoid robots are robots designed to resemble and mimic human behavior, both in appearance
                and functionality. These robots are capable of performing tasks traditionally reserved for humans, such
                as assisting in healthcare, customer service, and education. The defining characteristic of humanoid
                robots is their ability to interact with humans in a natural and intuitive way, using advanced
                algorithms for speech recognition, facial expression interpretation, and decision-making.</P>
            <P id="style2">Some of the most well-known humanoid robots include robots like ASIMO, Sophia, and Atlas,
                which have been designed for various purposes, from assisting the elderly and disabled to performing
                dangerous tasks in disaster-stricken areas. Humanoid robots are also becoming an integral part of
                research and development, where they help scientists better understand human cognition, biomechanics,
                and social interaction. With continued advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics, humanoid
                robots are expected to become more autonomous, capable of learning from experience, and performing
                increasingly complex tasks in the future.
